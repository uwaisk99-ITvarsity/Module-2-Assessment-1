 <p>Dining at the zoo, an experience not to be missed!!
    Located in some of the most impressive settings in the Park, overlooking either rivers or vast pristine bush land, the Restaurants at Kruger have something to offer everybody.
    
    From a Buffet to Table d' Hote, braai nights under the stars or bush braai's (to be reintroduced soon), surrounded by the wild , sit back, relax and allow our discreet and efficient staff to look after you whilst you experience the warmth of true South African hospitality and cuisine. Savour the freshest ingredients and tantalising treats at any one of the specialist restaurants available. </p>

                            <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT</p></strong>
